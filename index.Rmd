* "Presence" data are widely used by ecologists

* From presences data we can derive **distribution**

* **Distribution data** form the basis for biodiversity conservation and species management plans

---
# Background

Typical **grided species distribution data**:

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
library(spatstat)
library(sf)
library(GISTools)
library(tmap)

pres <- raster(ncol=10, nrow=10)
v_pres <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
values(pres) <- v_pres
plot(pres)
```
]

# Background

* **Distributional data** may be considered a poor source of information, especially when compared to **abundance data**

--

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
abs <- raster(ncol=10, nrow=10)
v_abs <- rpois(100, 5)
values(abs) <- v_abs
plot(abs)

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
image(pres)
image(abs)
```

# Background

* Even if this is the case, **distributional data** are often the only available data on species ecologists have access to ...

* On the bright side, since distributional data have been available for a long time a wide array of statistical tools exist to deal with it!

* Nevertheless, **distributional data** are more complex than we can think and **distributions** can result from different process!

* If that sounds confusing this is normal.

* The spatial statistic literature discuss different types of data that can be used to infer species distribution:

# A theoretical challenge

* For **presence / absence** data and **count data** we say that locations are **fixed**. This means that **we divide** a landscape into some plots (grids, quadrat) that we sample, **we go** at that location and **we observe**. 

* If the species was detected we count it as **presence** and **absence** otherwise

# A theoretical challenge

* **Presence‐only data** and more generally **point pattern data** arises through randomly encountering a species within a region and is typically collected in the form of museum or citizen science data. 

* We say that locations are **randomly distributed in space**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.height=5}
library(spatstat)
randomp <- rpoispp(lambda = 100)
plot(randomp, main = "Simulated point pattern")
```
]

---
# A theoretical challenge

* Ecologists usually modelled these data with **presence / absence** methods, usually sampling **pseudo-absence** through the landscapes if they had **presence-only** data.

--

* **However**, because of these conceptual differences, some argue that each type of data has to be used (i.e. modelled) with different strategies. 

--

* **Moreover**, In the recent ecological science literature, it is asserted that a common modeling framework can be used for all data types, that presence/absence data modeling can be induced under a **presence‐only framework**.

# What does presence mean?

* To understand **presence** we need to understand the concept of **absence**.

--

* First, a species can be absent from a place where environmental conditions meet the species’ requirements for diverse reasons

--

* A species can also be absent from an area because the environmental requirements at this location are not met and the species cannot survive.

--

* A final type of absence is due to the nature of distributional information which are very often incomplete and biased. We call this a **false absence**.

# What does presence mean?

* **False absences** can be the result of a multitude of reasons, the most common are **preferential sampling** or **failed detection**.

* This constitute the most important source of uncertainty in SDM and is a main factor of statistical developments.

* The definition of the concept of **"presence / absence"** hardly has a single answer.

# What does presence mean?

* The definition of the concept of **"presence / absence"** hardly has a single answer.

* The main question is whether **presence/absence is viewed as an event at point level or at areal level.**

# What does presence mean?

* A formal definition (Kery & Royle, 2015) is that presence-absence is a quantity that is directly derived from abundance and that **both abundance and occurrence are simply areal summary of an underlying spatial point pattern**.

* We can then assert that occurrence is equivalent to the event that there is **at least one “point” falling within a predetermined spatial unit** or that the abundance of these points in a spatial unit is greater than zero.

* Nevertheless, one can argue that the presence / absence is a property of the observer and therefore of the point.

---
# What does presence mean?

* I argue that the observation captures **“detection / non detection”** and not “presence / absence”.

* **“detection / non detection”** becomes a property of the point (the observer) while **“presence / absence”** becomes a property of the area.

* It follows that the actual or real distribution of a species is in fact never observed and we need to account for it. We call it a **latent state**.

# Towards a unified framework

* A unified framework on species distribution rely on the implicit assumption that **the latent state** (i.e. the true species distribution) result from **an underlying spatial point process** (i.e. is a point pattern). In particular we need to assume the two following axioms:

* 1) Species distributions are the **aggregated spatial locations of all individuals of the same species** across a geographic domain.

* 2) The distribution **can be described as a spatial point** in which the local intensity (or density) of individuals varies.

* If we know the underlying point generating process, we can also specify a **mathematical relationship between density and occupancy** and how the relationship changes based on the cell area.

* In other word, given the area of the cell A, we can count the number of points N and if N < 1 then we can show that the cell can be considered as a “presence”.

# Take home message:

* The concept of **presence and absence** is more complicated than it seems

* Even though there is a wide range of data type, the can be used (i.e. modelled) with a single framework.
